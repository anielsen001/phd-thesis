\chapter{Low T$_c$ scanning SQUID microscope}
\label{chap:ssm_appendix}

\section{Introduction}

The \lowtc\ scanning SQUID microscope (SSM) is based on a design
originally by Anna Mathai, Randy Black and Fred Wellstood
\cite{black_apl_62_2128_1993,black_phdthesis} 
with many additional refinements provided by Fred Cawthorne and Rick
Newrock of the University of Cincinnati\cite{newrock_addr}. 
Our description of the probe may be overly verbose here, if only 
to serve as a source of documentation and as an archive of which
techniques have proven useful. 

The probe used in these experiments was designed to primarily look at 
niobium \jjas\ so niobium technology was
incorporated into the SQUID sensor. An important feature of the 
Black-Wellstood design is that it thermally isolates the SQUID
and the sample from each other. This is in contrast to other
designs\cite{kirtley_apl_66_1138_1995} in which the SQUID tip
(on a cantilever)
is in direct thermal contact with the sample. 
We use the SSM primarily to measure quasi-DC magnetic flux, but
we have made some low frequency measurements as well.%
\footnote{See, \eg, the section on AC susceptibility in 
YBCO on RABiTS, \ref{sec:rabits_ac_sus}, p.~\pageref{sec:rabits_ac_sus}.}

\section{Mechanical design}
\label{ssm_mech_design}

The sample stage moves around in both $x$ and $y$ through the action of 
two linear pushrods, which are connected to screws at the room
temperature flange of the probe.
The SQUID tip remains stationary
but may be moved in the $z$ direction by means of a wedge which 
is also attached to a rod and screw assembly at the room temperature
flange of the probe. This basic design comes from the Black-Wellstood
microscope design\cite{black_phdthesis,black_apl_62_2128_1993}.
We have added copper heat sinking which extends through the cold
flange directly into the liquid helium bath. There is separate heat
sinking for both the SQUID and the sample. This heat sinking is 
shown schematically in \FigRef{fig:heat_sinking} along with the
thermometry. 
A sketch along the length of the probe shows the general arrangement
of the various parts, \FigRef{fig:overall_probe_sketch}.

\subsection{Thermometer placement}
\index{thermometer!placement}

Both the sample and SQUID are mounted on sapphire tips
sitting at the end of copper cold fingers. Immediately below each of the 
sapphire tips sits a germanium thermometer\cite{lakeshore_cryotronics} 
(sensitive from about $3\,\kelvin$ to $100\,\kelvin$)
which allows us to monitor
temperature of both the sample and SQUID during 
operation. 

A thermometer mounted in the plastic housing at the cold
end provides some information about the heat produced by
friction. 
Because the plastic has a very low thermal conductivity,
the plastic will heat up during continuous scanning, absorbing 
heat from friction, until it becomes saturated. 
At saturation we can no longer control the 
temperature of the SQUID and sample, 
because the plastic temperature exceeds the SQUID operating temperature.
The plastic must cool
must
cool before subsequent measurements may be taken. 

A thermometer mounted on
top of the cold flange, in the \lhe\ bath, is useful for 
monitoring the probe temperature during initial cool down.
The sample and the SQUID tips are provided with heaters
wound from twisted pairs of manganin wire of about
$50\,\Omega$. A separate Neocera LTC-21
temperature controller\cite{neocera} is attached to each thermometer-heater
pair for the sample and SQUID. With this arrangement 
we can separately control the sample and SQUID temperatures
during operation. 

\subsection{Friction}

\index{friction}
\index{scanning!friction}
\index{heating}
\label{sec:squid_vs_temperature}

Heat generated by friction in the scanning mechanism
may raise the sample temperature by as much as a kelvin during
different parts of the scanning cycle. 
\FigRef{fig:squid_vs_temperature} demonstrates how the output of the
SQUID electronics change as the temperature of the SQUID changes
from about $4.2\,\kelvin$ to $6.75\,\kelvin$. 
(Above $6.75\,\kelvin$ the SQUID can no longer be kept in the 
flux-locked loop.)
The total change in output voltage in \FigRef{fig:squid_vs_temperature}
corresponds to $0.417\,\Phinot$ in the SQUID, which
can easily swamp a real flux change if the temperature is not 
controlled or the shift is not corrected.

\subsection{Vacuum quality}

SQUID and sample
temperature stability 
during scanning strongly depends upon the quality of the 
vacuum inside the probe. If there are no helium leaks
on the cold end, any gases in the probe will be 
cryopumped out and the SQUID temperature during scanning may be
controlled.
Using two temperature controllers
we can hold the SQUID and
sample temperatures to within $0.01\,\kelvin$ during scanning. 

\subsection{Scanning range}

\index{scanning range}
\label{sec:scanning_mechanical}
\index{stepper motors!calibration}
\index{stepper motors!coordinates}
The scanning range of the mechanism is limited to approximately
$20\,\mm$ in the $x$ direction and to approximately
$10\,\mm$ in the $y$ direction.
The data files output by the scanning computer index the 
$x$ and $y$ coordinates in terms of the number of steps taken
by the stepper motors to move the sample. We have calibrated these
stepper motor steps to real world motion 
at room temperature and found
$10814.9\pm 5.2$ steps per millimeter in the $x$ direction,
and $42933.\pm 90.$ steps per millimeter in the $y$ direction.
For the calibration we measured the actual movement of the 
sample stage using calipers. This movement was compared to the
number of steps moved by the stepper motors.  
More detail on the coordinate system used for scanning is 
discussed in section \ref{steppermotors}, p.~\pageref{steppermotors}. 
Additionally, data collected on samples of known geometry typically
compare quite well to the known size.\footnote{For a comparison, see
the Meissner state current density profile fit in section
\ref{sec:ybco_meissner_state}, p.~\pageref{sec:ybco_meissner_state}.}

\section{SQUID design}
\index{SQUID!IC design}

SQUIDs are fabricated out of $\mathrm{Nb}-\mathrm{Al}_2\mathrm{0}_3-
\mathrm{Nb}$ \jjsnoun\ and made at the Hypres, Inc. foundry%
\cite{hypres}. An optical micrograph of a
SQUID is shown in \FigRef{fig:SQUID_optical_close}. 
We integrated the feedback coil for the SQUID flux locked loop
onto the chip. The primary drawback is that there is
not enough room to make a four-point measurement of the SQUID.
We make a two point measurement, and use the other two contact pads for 
biasing the feedback coil. 

A single SQUID after dicing is about $1\,\mm$ square and an
optical image of one SQUID for the tip is shown in 
\FigRef{fig:SQUID_optical_large}(a). 
Nine of these SQUIDs are included in Hypres design 
\texttt{APNSQD1}.\index{\texttt{APNSQD1}}%
We order the chip from Hypres and when it arrives, 
dice it up into the nine SQUIDS for use in the probe. 
The procedure for mounting the SQUIDs into the 
probe is described in 
section \ref{app:squid_mounting}, p.~\pageref{app:squid_mounting}.

The inside dimension of the SQUID loop, $10\,\micron$,
ultimately limits the spatial resolution of the SQUID. Redesigning
the SQUID with a smaller loop would, in principle, improve the
spatial resolution.
However, the largest obstacle to increasing the spatial 
resolution is the SQUID-sample separation. 
We have difficulty achieving  a
SQUID-sample separation less than twenty micrometers and in practice
the separation is typically closer to fifty micrometers. We 
have designed SQUIDs with smaller geometry, but have never used them, 
nor tested them. These smaller SQUIDs are described in design specification 
\texttt{APNSQD2}.\index{\texttt{APNSQD2}}

\section{Electronic design}
\index{SQUID electronics}

The electronics used to measure the flux impinging upon the SQUID use
the well known flux-locked loop.\footnote{See the excellent discussion 
in Ref.~\cite{black_phdthesis} and the references contained therein.}
Additionally, the electronics used for this probe have had the analog
phase detector of \InLineRef{black_phdthesis}\
replaced with a digital phase detector.

\subsection{Digital phase detector}
\label{sec:dig_phase_shifter}
\index{SQUID electronics!digital phase detector}

The
digital phase detector was designed by Fred Cawthorne and put together
in the electronics shop at the University of Cincinnati in
collaboration with Rick Newrock. The schematic for this phase
shifter is shown in \FigRef{fig:digital_phase_scheme}. The
digital phase detector has a resolution of eight bits, yielding
a lowest significant bit equal to $0.025$ radians. 
%which provides a 
%significant enhancement over the analog phase shifters used
%previously that might switch between zero and $\pi$ radians.

\subsection{Electronic frequency response}
\index{SQUID electronics!frequency response}

Once the SQUID electronics and SQUID are integrated together, we 
can measure the frequency response of the system. Ultimately, the 
output from the electronics passes through an integrator, so the 
band pass of the electronics cannot be any greater than that of the 
integrator. The band pass of the integrator is designed to be 
about $10\,\kHz$. We used a Hewlett-Packard 3562A
spectrum analyzer\cite{HP}
to measure the frequency response of a SQUID (sitting in the 
experimental Dewar) coupled with the 
SQUID electronics. 
We can see, in \FigRef{fig:freq_response} 
that $1/f$ noise exists below $500\,\mathrm{mHz}$
and the white noise persists up to about
$10\,\kHz$, where it is cut off by the integrator roll off. The 
white noise region has a floor of $5.0\,\mu\Phi_0/\sqrt{\Hz}$
which translates to $703\,\mathrm{fT}/\sqrt{\Hz}$.
