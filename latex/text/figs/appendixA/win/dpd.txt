Digital Phase Detector

The key portion of the following circuit is the CD4066 quad bilateral switch, connected as a switching type phase sensitive detector. 

System timing is derived from a 25.6Mhz crystal clock.  The clock is divided by two presetable 8 bit dividers, type 74ALS867A.  One of the two is preset at the terminal count and the other is programmable by a circuit board mounted DIP switch.  The 100Khz output of the preset divider, U2, is buffered by opamp U4B to allow external monitoring of the clock.

By applying these two phase adjustable 100Khz clocks to two opposing quadrants of the detector, a DC error voltage may be derived during nonsynchronous periods in signal applied to the external input port.  The input from the squid preamp is applied to 1 and 8 of the detector with reference to common at pins 4 and 11.  U4a amplifies the error voltage and damps spurious harmonics by the use of  C3.

To set up the proper phase relationship between clock quadrants;

1.	Remove all AC bias from the squid.

2.	Set the experimental baseline state in the squid, normal or not.

3.	Set the shift code for U1 (using the DIP switch S1) so  that the error voltage output from the 
detector is zero.  Note that switch nine is a phase reversal switch.

This completes the setup procedure.  Any phase shifts in the input signal from the normal state will produce a bipolar error voltage proportional to the phase error between the system clock and the squid signal.
